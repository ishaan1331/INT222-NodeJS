In this article , we are going to discuss about ACID properties of a DBMS system . But before exploring
,ACID properties , first let us have a basic insight about DBMS . <br><br>

    DBMS is an acronym for Database Management System , which is a software which helps in management of a database.
    A database refers to an organized collection of any structured data stored electronically in 
    an electronic system , while Managament refers to handling resources of any organisation or system.

<div class="main-para ACID">
<dl>
    <dt>TRANSACTION</dt>
    <dd>A transaction refers to a single logical unit of work or query that makes any changes in
        the database or the database content . Since there are changes being done in the database , 
        to maintain the consisteny and dataflow , there are some properties which are needed to be
        taken care of. Such properties are called ACID properties.<br><br>
    </dd>

<div align = "center">
    <img src="images/acid.png" class='main-image'>
</div>

<dt>ATOMICITY</dt>
    <dd>The concept of atomicity refers to how atomic the data remains.
         It means that if any operation is performed on the data, it 
         should be done totally, partially, or not at all. It also implies 
         that the process shouldn't stop midway through or only partially
          complete. When performing actions on a transaction, 
        the operation should be carried out whole, not only partially.<br><br>

        For example , assume that person A sends $10 from his account which has $30 in his account , 
        to a person B with already having $100 in his account . Now inside all this transaction , two 
        processes are taking place. Firstly , 10$ will be deducted from account of person A , and same 
        will be credited in account B . But in case account B is unable to gain $10 but it is deducted
        from account A , the transaction would be considered as partial . <br>
        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/atomicity.png" class="main-image" >
        </div>

        But if both of the operations happen neatly the transaction will be said to be atomic. 
        <div align="center">

        </div>
    </dd>

    <dt>CONSISTENCY</dt>
    <dd>Consistency means that the value should always be maintained. 
        In DBMS, the integrity of the data must be upheld,
         which calls for any changes to the database to always
          be retained. Data integrity is crucial in transactions 
          because it ensures that the database is consistent 
          both before and after the transaction. 
        The information should always be accurate.<br><br>

        For example , assume there are three accounts A , B and C . A
        is making  a transaction to both B and C . Now A gives account B 
        50$ so its balance becomes 250$ after deduction of 50$ and B's 
        balance increases by 50$. Now , A sends 20$ to account C , and its balance is 
        now shown as 230$ (after deduction of 20$) and C's balance increases by 20$. 
        So overall ,  we can say that this whole series of transactions was consistent
        because there was no malfunctioning sduring the whole transaction. So the data is consistent.

        <div align="center">
            <img src="images/consistency.png" class="main-image" >
        </div>
    </dd>

    <dt>ISOLATION</dt>
    <dd>Isolation is another word for separation. 
        Isolation in DBMS refers to a database's 
        ability to operate concurrently while ensuring 
        that no data should impact the other. In other 
        words, when an operation on one database is
         finished, an operation on another database 
         should start. It implies that two operations
         on two different databases may not have an impact
          on one another's value. The consistency should be
           upheld when two or more transactions take place at
            once in the case of transactions. Other transactions
             won't notice any modifications made during a specific transaction until 
        the change has been committed to memory.<br><br>

        For example , The value of both accounts shouldn't
         change if two activities are being executed simultaneously
          on two different accounts. The value should be maintained. 
          As seen in the diagram below, 
          account A is making T1 and T2 transactions 
          to accounts B and C, but each are carrying them 
          out separately and without interfering with one another.
         It is referred to as isolation.

         <div align="center">
            <img src="images/isolation.png" class="main-image" >
        </div>
    </dd>

    <dt>DURABILITY</dt>
    <dd>Something is permanent if it is durable.
        Durability in DBMS refers to the guarantee that data remains 
        in the database permanently once an operation has been successfully
         completed. Data should be so perfectly durable that it can still
          function even in the event of a system failure or crash. However, 
          if it disappears, the recovery manager is now in charge of making 
           sure the database is durable. Every time we make changes, 
        we must use the COMMIT command to commit the settings.<br><br>
